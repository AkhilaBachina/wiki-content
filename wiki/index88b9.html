<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Smart_dog"> Smart dog </span></h2>
<p>A wealthy man decided to go on a safari in Africa. He took his faithful pet dog along for company. One day the dog starts chasing butterflies and before long he discovers that he is lost. So, wandering about he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch. 
</p><p>The dog thinks, "Boy, I'm in deep trouble now." 
</p><p>Then he noticed some bones on the ground close by, and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. 
</p><p>Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog exclaims loudly, "Man, that was one delicious leopard. I wonder if there are any more around here?" 
</p><p>Hearing this the leopard halts his attack in mid stride, as a look of terror comes over him, and slinks away into the trees. 
</p><p>"Whew", says the leopard. "That was close. That dog nearly had me." 
</p><p>Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. 
</p><p>So, off he goes. But the dog saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figured that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. 
</p><p>The cat is furious at being made a fool of and says, "Here monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine." 
</p><p>Now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks," What am I going to do now?" 
</p><p>But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers pretending he hasn't seen them yet. 
</p><p>And just when they get close enough to hear, the dog says, "Where's that monkey. I just can never trust him. I sent him off half an hour ago to bring me another leopard, and he's still not back!!" 
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bubba_Knows_Everyone"> Bubba Knows Everyone </span></h2>
<p>There was a man named Bubba and Bubba knew EVERYONE in the whole world!! 
</p><p>Once when Bubba got a new job, he says to his new boss, "Boss, I know everyone in the whole world!" His boss doesn't believe him, so he says "No you do not know everyone in the whole world" but Bubba says "Yes I do!" so Bubba's boss says "Well prove it!" then Bubba says "Pick someone and I know them!" 
</p><p>Well Bubba's boss thinks for a minute and then comes up with a name. 
</p><p>"Tom Selleck! I bet you don't know Tom Selleck!" Bubba say "Tom Selleck! Tom and I were in boy scouts together when we were kids!" but Bubba's boss says "No you weren't!" then Bubba says "Yes we were!" so they fly to Hollywood and drive up to Tom Selleck's house. Bubba knocks on the door and Tom Selleck answers and Bubba says "Tom!!!" and Tom says "Bubba!" and they hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba's boss can't believe it. But then he thinks "Well that could happen, it's just one person," so he tells Bubba and Bubba says "OK, pick somebody else!" 
</p><p>This time Bubba's boss has someone in mind! "The president, Bill Clinton! You don't know Bill Clinton!" but Bubba says "Oh yes I do! Bill and I were on debate team together in college!" Bubba's boss says "No you weren't!" and Bubba says "Yes we were!" So they fly to Washington and they catch up with the President at a press conference. They work their way through the crowd until Bubba gets close enough to catch Clinton's eye and waves "Bill!" and the President waves "Bubba!" and after the press conference they hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba's boss is stunned - he can't believe it. But then he thinks "Well that's just two people in one country - that doesn't mean he knows everyone in the whole world!" so he tells Bubba and Bubba says "OK, pick someone out of the world spectrum and I know them!" 
</p><p>And Bubba's boss knows just who to pick so he says "The Pope! You do not know the Pope!" and Bubba says "The Pope! The Pose BAPTIZED me!" and Bubba's boss says "No he didn't!" and Bubba says "Yes he did!" So they fly to Rome where the Pope is giving Mass in front of hundreds of thousands of people. They work their way through the crowd - without much luck - so Bubba says "Boss, we're never gonna get there together through all these people so I tell you what - I'll work my way up there and when I do, I'll give you a sign that show you I know the Pope!" and he leaves. Well Bubba's boss waits and waits and waits and just when he's about to give up, he sees the Pope come out onto the balcony and right there beside him is Bubba! 
</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Bubba's boss passes out. Bubba comes back and finds his boss passed out and he fans him and says "Boss! Boss! Wake up!" and when his boss comes to, he asks "Boss what happened?" Bubba's boss looks at Bubba and says, "OK, I can see Tom Selleck. I can see Bill Clinton and I can even take the Pope! But when somebody standing next to me asks 
</p><p>'Who's that up there with Bubba?', that's a little more than I can take!"

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Eurolanguage_Year_2000"> Eurolanguage Year 2000 </span></h2>
<p>The European Union commissioners have announced that agreement has been reached to adopt English as the preferred language for European communications, rather than German, which was the other possibility. 
</p><p>As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish [Euro for short]. 
</p><p>In the first year, 's' will be used instead of the soft 'c'. Sertainly, sivil servants will reseive this news with joy. Also, the hard 'c' will be replased with 'k'. Not only will this klear up konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter. 
</p><p>There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome 'ph' will be replased by 'f'. This will make words like 'fotograf' 20 persent shorter. 
</p><p>In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which ahve always ben a deternent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of silent 'e' in the languaj is disgrasful, and they would go. 
</p><p>By the forth uer, peopl wil be receptiv to steps such as replasing the 'th' by 'z' and the 'w' by 'v'. During the fifz uer, ze unesesary 'o' kan be dropd from vords kontaining 'ou', and similar changes nud of kors be splid to ozeer kombinations of leters. 
</p><p>After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli senisbl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor tubls or difikultis and avrivun vil find it ezi tu understand ech ozer. 
</p><p>Ze drem vil finali kum tru.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Snake_and_the_Bunny"> The Snake and the Bunny </span></h2>
<p>Once upon a time, in a nice little forest, there lived an orphaned bunny and an orphaned snake. 
</p><p>By a surprising coincidence, both were blind from birth. One day, the bunny was hopping through the forest, and the snake was slithering through the forest, when the bunny tripped over the snake and fell down. 
</p><p>This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit. "Oh, my," said the bunny, "I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I've been blind since birth, so, I can't see where I'm going. In fact,! since I'm also an orphan, I don't even know what I am." 
</p><p>It's quite ok," replied the snake. "Actually, my story is as yours. I too have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and work out what you are so at least you'll have that going for you." 
</p><p>"Oh, that would be wonderful" replied the bunny. So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said,! "Well, you're covered with soft fur, you have really long ears, your nose twitches, and you have a soft cottony tail. I'd say that you must be a bunny rabbit." 
</p><p>"Oh, thank you, thank you," cried the bunny, in obvious excitement. The bunny suggested to the snake, "Maybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you've helped me." 
</p><p>So the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, "Well, you're smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone and no balls. I'd say you must be either a team leader or possibly someone in senior management."
